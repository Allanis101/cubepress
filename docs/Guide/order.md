# Order SIMs


## New Organization
Once you have an organization and account set up with Cube, you may order SIMs directly from regional sales representatives.

## Existing Organization
Once signin, you will be able to see all the SIM assets your organization already has. For more SIMs, do approach your sales.

If your have more than one organization, you may also choose to transfer SIMs from one organization to another, so long you are administrators for both organizaions.


::: tip
Do allow **1-3 working days** before you can view the newly ordered SIMs to **appear in your Cube account**.
